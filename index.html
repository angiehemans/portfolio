            <h4>The Challenge</h4>
            <p>When I joined as the sole designer, the company was preparing to rebuild its entire platform from scratch. The existing product had grown unwieldy. The codebase was difficult to maintain, the UI was inconsistent, and the team struggled to ship quickly. Leadership made a bold decision: start fresh with a modern tech stack.</p>

Users from both legacy platforms needed to be migrated to a single, unified experience. It had to feel familiar enough to ease the transition but fresh enough to signal a new chapter.</p>

          </div>
          <p>I've spent the last decade at the intersection of design and engineering, leading teams while staying hands-on with the work. I've scaled a design org from 1 to 8, shipped products that grew user bases by tens of thousands, and built design systems from the ground up. I often implement them in code myself.</p>
          <p>My path to design leadership started with a deep curiosity about how things work. I learned early on that great design doesn't exist in a vacuum. It lives in the code, in the systems, and in the way teams collaborate to ship. That's why I've always stayed close to implementation.</p>
          <p>Today, I'm most energized by the challenge of building something meaningful. Whether that's a product, a team, or a system that helps both thrive, I want to be in the work, not just directing it from the sidelines.</p>
